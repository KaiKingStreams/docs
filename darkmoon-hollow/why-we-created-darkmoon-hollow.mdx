## Message from Sean:

Hello, my name is Sean, though in the gaming community, I go by Kai. Alongside my friend River, I created Darkmoon Hollow from a simple idea — that games have the power to connect people in ways the real world sometimes forgets how to. What started as a shared passion slowly evolved into a home, a gathering place where stories intertwine, friendships form, and strangers become like family. Darkmoon Hollow exists to be a haven, a place where anyone is welcome, no matter where they come from, what they’re going through, or how lost they may feel. Here, you are allowed to be yourself without fear, to speak without being silenced, and to belong without having to earn your place. While I carry the title of President, I stand beside this community, not above it — just another gamer, another dreamer, another person who believes that connection, kindness, and creativity can build something lasting. Every voice matters here, every story leaves a mark, and every shared moment adds to the soul of Darkmoon Hollow. This isn’t just a server or a name — it’s a living world shaped by its people, and as long as it exists, it will remain a place where no one has to walk alone. If you want to know more about why I created Darkmoon Hollow, please send me an email or shoot me a DM on the sites we have or through any socials I have. I'll link my email and social media accounts below this message. Hope you all in our community are enjoying it, and hope to see more come in. Also, yes, it might not look like much at first, but we are taking our time on building the community, so if you want to invite friend,s go for it.
