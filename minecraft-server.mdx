## Server setup

### System requirements

Before setting up your Minecraft server, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **RAM**: Minimum 2GB, recommended 4GB or more
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended
- **Storage**: At least 1GB free space
- **Java**: Java 17 or higher for Minecraft 1.18+

### Installing the server

1. Download the latest Minecraft server JAR file from the official website
2. Create a new folder for your server files
3. Place the server JAR file in the folder
4. Run the server for the first time to generate configuration files
5. Accept the EULA by editing `eula.txt` and setting `eula=true`

```bash
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
```

## Server configuration

### Basic settings

Edit `server.properties` to configure your server:

- **server-port**: Default is 25565
- **gamemode**: survival, creative, adventure, or spectator
- **difficulty**: peaceful, easy, normal, or hard
- **max-players**: Maximum number of players allowed
- **pvp**: Enable or disable player vs player combat
- **spawn-protection**: Radius of spawn protection in blocks

### Performance optimization

Improve server performance with these settings:

- **view-distance**: Reduce to 8-10 for better performance
- **simulation-distance**: Controls how far away chunks are processed
- **max-tick-time**: Prevents server watchdog from shutting down
- **network-compression-threshold**: Compress packets larger than this value

### Whitelist and permissions

Control who can join your server:

1. Enable whitelist in `server.properties`: `white-list=true`
2. Add players: `/whitelist add <username>`
3. Remove players: `/whitelist remove <username>`
4. Make players operators: `/op <username>`

## Managing your server

### Starting and stopping

Start your server:
```bash
java -Xmx2G -Xms2G -jar server.jar nogui
```

Stop your server safely:
- Use the `/stop` command in the console
- Never force-close the server to prevent corruption

### Backups

Regularly backup your server:

1. Stop the server or use a backup plugin
2. Copy the entire server folder to a safe location
3. Include the `world` folder and all configuration files
4. Schedule automatic backups for important servers

### Plugins and mods

Extend your server functionality:

- **Bukkit/Spigot/Paper**: For plugins (recommended for most servers)
- **Forge/Fabric**: For mods (requires client-side mods too)
- Download plugins from trusted sources like SpigotMC or CurseForge
- Place plugin JAR files in the `plugins` folder

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

Common issues and solutions:

- **Java version**: Ensure you have the correct Java version installed
- **Port already in use**: Change the port in `server.properties`
- **Insufficient memory**: Increase the `-Xmx` value in your start command
- **Corrupted world**: Restore from a backup or delete the world folder

### Connection issues

If players can't connect:

- **Firewall**: Open port 25565 (or your custom port)
- **Port forwarding**: Configure your router to forward the server port
- **IP address**: Share your public IP address with players
- **Server full**: Increase `max-players` in server.properties

### Performance problems

If your server is lagging:

- Reduce `view-distance` and `simulation-distance`
- Use Paper or Purpur for better performance
- Install optimization plugins like ClearLagg
- Upgrade your server hardware or hosting plan
- Limit entity spawning and redstone contraptions

## Common commands

Essential server commands:

- `/whitelist add <player>`: Add player to whitelist
- `/op <player>`: Give player operator permissions
- `/gamemode <mode> <player>`: Change player's gamemode
- `/tp <player> <target>`: Teleport players
- `/give <player> <item> <amount>`: Give items to players
- `/time set <value>`: Change the time of day
- `/weather <clear|rain|thunder>`: Change weather
- `/difficulty <level>`: Change difficulty
- `/save-all`: Save the world manually
