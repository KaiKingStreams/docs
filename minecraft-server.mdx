## Server setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up your Minecraft server, ensure you have:

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed
- At least 2GB of RAM available
- A stable internet connection
- Port forwarding access on your router

### Installation steps

1. Download the Minecraft server software from the official website
2. Create a new folder for your server files
3. Place the server `.jar` file in the folder
4. Run the server for the first time to generate configuration files
5. Accept the EULA by editing `eula.txt` and setting `eula=true`
6. Start the server again

```bash
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
```

## Server configuration

### Server properties

Edit `server.properties` to configure your server:

- **server-port**: Default is `25565`
- **gamemode**: Set to `survival`, `creative`, `adventure`, or `spectator`
- **difficulty**: Choose `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, or `hard`
- **max-players**: Maximum number of players allowed
- **pvp**: Enable or disable player vs player combat
- **spawn-protection**: Radius of spawn protection in blocks
- **white-list**: Enable whitelist mode for approved players only

### Whitelist management

To manage your server whitelist:

```bash
# Enable whitelist
whitelist on

# Add a player
whitelist add <username>

# Remove a player
whitelist remove <username>

# List whitelisted players
whitelist list
```

### Operator permissions

Grant operator permissions to trusted players:

```bash
# Make a player an operator
op <username>

# Remove operator status
deop <username>
```

## Port forwarding

To allow external players to connect:

1. Access your router's admin panel
2. Navigate to port forwarding settings
3. Forward port `25565` (or your custom port) to your server's local IP
4. Use TCP protocol
5. Save the settings and restart your router

## Connecting to your server

### Local connection

Players on the same network can connect using:
- Your local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
- Or simply `localhost` if playing on the same machine

### External connection

Players outside your network need:
- Your public IP address (find at whatismyip.com)
- The server port (default: `25565`)
- Format: `your.public.ip.address:25565`

## Common issues

### Server won't start

If your server fails to start:

- Check that Java is properly installed
- Verify you accepted the EULA
- Ensure the port isn't already in use
- Check server logs for specific error messages

### Players can't connect

If players can't connect to your server:

- Verify port forwarding is configured correctly
- Check firewall settings aren't blocking the port
- Confirm you're sharing the correct IP address
- Ensure the server is running and not full

### Performance issues

To improve server performance:

- Allocate more RAM using `-Xmx` and `-Xms` flags
- Reduce view distance in `server.properties`
- Limit the number of entities and mobs
- Use server optimization plugins
- Consider upgrading your hardware

## Backup and maintenance

### Creating backups

Regularly backup your server:

1. Stop the server
2. Copy the entire server folder to a safe location
3. Include the `world` folder and all configuration files
4. Restart the server

### Updating the server

To update your Minecraft server:

1. Backup your current server
2. Download the latest server `.jar` file
3. Replace the old `.jar` file with the new one
4. Start the server and verify everything works
