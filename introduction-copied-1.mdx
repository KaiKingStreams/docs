## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Darkmoon Hollow Assets documentation**. This site serves as the authoritative source of information for understanding, using, and managing all assets provided under the Darkmoon Hollow Assets ecosystem. The documentation is designed to support users at every stage, from initial discovery to advanced implementation. Within these pages, you will find structured explanations of concepts, clear procedural guidance, and detailed references. Each section is written to prioritize clarity, consistency, and practical applicability. The goal of this documentation is to reduce friction and eliminate ambiguity when working with Darkmoon Hollow Assets. All content is maintained to reflect the current state of the product and its intended usage. Terminology is used consistently to help establish a shared understanding across teams and workflows. Where applicable, examples are provided to illustrate real-world use cases. This introduction marks the starting point for exploring the full capabilities of Darkmoon Hollow Assets.

Darkmoon Hollow Assets is built to be flexible, scalable, and reliable across a wide range of use cases. The documentation explains not only _how_ to use the assets, but also _why_ certain approaches are recommended. Readers will find guidance on setup, configuration, organization, and long-term maintenance. Core concepts are introduced progressively to ensure a smooth learning curve. More advanced sections dive deeper into optimization strategies and edge cases. The documentation is structured to support both linear reading and targeted lookup. You can follow guides step by step or jump directly to specific topics as needed. Each section is intended to stand on its own while still fitting into the larger system. References are included to clarify dependencies and relationships between components. This approach ensures that Darkmoon Hollow Assets can be integrated confidently into existing workflows.

If you are new to Darkmoon Hollow Assets, it is recommended to begin with the **Getting Started** section. That area provides a high-level overview and walks through the initial steps required for effective use. Users with prior experience may prefer to navigate directly to detailed guides or reference materials. The navigation structure is organized to make discovery efficient and predictable. Each major topic is grouped logically to reduce time spent searching for information. Updates and changes to the assets are reflected throughout the documentation to maintain accuracy. Best practices are highlighted to help avoid common mistakes. When applicable, constraints and limitations are clearly noted. This documentation is intended to be a living resource that evolves alongside the product. By following it, users can ensure they are using Darkmoon Hollow Assets as intended and to its fullest potential.

## Hosting

All **Darkmoon Hollow Assets** are run from **SimplisticNode**, which serves as the central platform for hosting, managing, and maintaining asset operations. SimplisticNode provides the underlying infrastructure required to ensure consistent performance, reliability, and availability across all supported assets. By consolidating operations within a single node environment, Darkmoon Hollow Assets can maintain standardized deployment and configuration practices. This approach reduces operational complexity and improves long-term maintainability. SimplisticNode is responsible for coordinating updates, monitoring asset health, and enforcing system-level requirements. It also enables controlled scaling as usage demands evolve. Centralized execution through SimplisticNode allows for predictable behavior across environments. Logging and diagnostics are handled at the node level to support troubleshooting and auditing. This design ensures that assets remain stable and manageable over time. As a result, SimplisticNode acts as the operational backbone for all Darkmoon Hollow Assets.
