title: "Email Issues"
description: "Navigating to the spam folder in your email account is useful when messages are mistakenly filtered or when you need to review unwanted mail. Email providers automatically sort suspicious messages into this folder, but the process to find it can be slightly different depending on the platform you're using. Understanding how to locate the spam section helps ensure that important emails are not overlooked or deleted without notice."

## **Gmail**

In Gmail, the spam folder is located in the left-hand sidebar beneath the main folder list. If you don’t see it right away, you may need to click "More" to expand the list. Once the hidden folders are visible, you will find "Spam" listed among them. Opening it will display all messages Google marked as suspicious or potentially harmful. From there, users can either delete emails permanently or mark legitimate ones as **"Not spam"** so they return to the inbox.

## **Yahoo**

Yahoo Mail also keeps a dedicated spam folder, which is generally found on the left side of the interface alongside Inbox, Sent, Drafts, and other folders. If you are using the Yahoo Mail app or website, simply scroll down the folder list until you see "Spam". In some cases, the folder may be collapsed, and tapping or clicking the folder icon may reveal more categories. Like Gmail, you can restore incorrect spam messages by selecting them and moving them back to the inbox.

## **Outlook**

Outlook places spam messages under a folder labeled "Junk Email" rather than "Spam," but the function is the same. Whether you're using Outlook on the web or the desktop application, the Junk Email folder can be found in the sidebar where your mailbox folders are listed. When you open it, you’ll find messages filtered by Outlook’s security system. If you retrieve a message that shouldn't be there, right-clicking or selecting "Not Junk" will help Outlook learn and improve future filtering.

## **Other**

Other providers such as ProtonMail, AOL, iCloud, and business-based platforms also use similar labeling and placement for spam folders. Most commonly, the folder appears within the main mailbox list and may require expanding the menu to view. Regardless of which service is used, the controls inside the spam folder usually allow you to restore messages, block senders, or permanently delete them for security reasons.

> It’s important to review your spam folder periodically, because automated filters are not always perfect. Sometimes newsletters, registration emails, password resets, or even personal messages may be mistakenly flagged. Checking the folder every few days ensures nothing important is missed. If you want to reduce future errors, marking trusted emails as safe or adding senders to your contacts list can prevent them from being routed to spam again.
