title: "Before Asking for Help"
description: "Before requesting support, please take a moment to go through this checklist. Stormhold is a large and complex modpack, and many issues can be resolved quickly by checking a few common things first."
---

- **Restart the game and launcher** – This fixes a surprising number of issues.
- **Confirm your Minecraft version** – Stormhold is built for **Minecraft 1.20.1 (Forge)** only.
- **Do not remove mods** – Missing or altered mods can cause crashes, missing recipes, or broken progression.
- **Check RAM allocation** – Make sure you have at least **6–8 GB of RAM** allocated.
- **Disable shaders temporarily** – If you’re experiencing crashes or extreme lag, shaders are often the cause.
- **Verify the issue is reproducible** – Try to recreate the problem to confirm it wasn’t a one-time glitch.

### Check Logs and Errors

If the game crashes or fails to launch:

- Open the **latest.log** or **crash-report** file
- Look for clear error messages or missing dependencies
- Do **not** delete logs before asking for help

Providing logs greatly increases the chance of a fast and accurate solution.

### Provide Useful Information

When asking for help, include:

- A brief description of what you were doing
- What you expected to happen vs what actually happened
- Screenshots or short clips (if visual)
- Crash logs or error messages (pastebin-style preferred)

Avoid vague messages like _“It’s broken”_ or _“Doesn’t work”_ — details matter.
