title: "Stormhold – Modpack Help"
description: "Welcome to Stormhold! This page is your go-to guide for mod-related help, troubleshooting, and general support while playing the pack. Stormhold is a large, progression-focused modpack, and understanding how its systems work together will help you get the best experience."
---

## General Modpack Information

- **Minecraft Version:** 1.20.1 (Forge)
- **Pack Focus:** Automation, magic, space exploration, ancient technology
- **Core Pillars:** Create-style engineering, advanced tech, spellcraft, interplanetary travel, and large-scale exploration

Stormhold is designed for **long-term worlds**. Progression is intentional—take your time and don’t rush systems that are meant to scale.

---

## Performance & Setup Tips

If you experience lag, stuttering, or long load times:

- Allocate **6–8 GB of RAM** (more for servers or shaders)
- Use the **default graphics settings first**, then increase visuals gradually
- Shaders are optional—disable them if performance drops
- Avoid adding extra heavy mods unless you know they are compatible

If the game fails to launch, double-check that:

- You are using the correct Forge version
- No mods were removed from the pack
- Java is up to date

---

## Automation & Tech Help

Stormhold features multiple tech paths that can be used together:

- Mechanical automation (belts, gears, moving parts)
- Electrical and energy-based machines
- Advanced processing chains and power generation

**Tips:**

- Start small and scale up—large factories work best when planned
- Chunk loading can help automation but may affect performance
- Storage systems work best when centralized

---

## Magic & Progression Help

Magic systems in Stormhold are **progression-based**, not instant power boosts.

- Unlock spells gradually
- Experiment with spell combinations
- Many magical systems can automateely integrate with automation

If something feels weak early-game, that’s normal—magic scales with investment.

---

## Exploration & Dimensions

Stormhold heavily expands world generation and structures.

- Expect dangerous dungeons and powerful bosses
- Bring supplies—many structures are meant for mid-to-late game
- Some dimensions require preparation before entering

Use navigation tools wisely and mark important locations.

---

## Space & Late-Game Content

Space progression is **endgame-oriented**:

- Prepare infrastructure before launching
- Power, oxygen, and materials matter
- Other planets are not safe zones

Space content is designed to reward players who master earlier systems first.

---

## Stargates, Travel & Transport

Fast travel systems are powerful but intentional:

- Stargates and transporters may require setup and resources
- They are best used for established bases and hubs
- Not all locations are meant to be instantly accessible

Exploration still matters—even with fast travel available.

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

**Game won’t launch:**

- Check crash logs
- Verify all mods are present
- Reinstall the pack if needed

**Low FPS:**

- Reduce render distance
- Disable shaders

**Missing recipes or items:**
