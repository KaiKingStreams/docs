  ## Server Update – World Reset Required

  Good news — the server is now back online.

  However, due to world generation corruption, the current world cannot be safely maintained. To ensure long-term stability and proper terrain generation, we will be performing a full world reset.

  To help everyone get established properly:

  Creative mode will be temporarily enabled so players can travel far out from spawn to find a suitable base location.,

  You may place down a starter base and a town hall during this period.,

  After that, the server will return to Survival mode for everyone.,

  Let it also be known:

  Additionally, if you build large contraptions (especially Create-based machines), they must include a shut-off switch (lever or similar mechanism). This is required to maintain server performance and prevent future issues.

  We appreciate your patience and understanding as we move into this fresh start.
